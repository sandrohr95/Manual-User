FIMED application for flexible integration of biomedical data is a new soft- ware solution that facilitates the handling of large amounts of heterogeneous data in clinical research processes, thus improving the efficiency and quality of the data. It offers numerous benefits for the user in each of the aspects of the phases of clinical trials, including the possibility of inserting patient data dynamically and performing different studies. This software application has been designed to guarantee scalability, versatility and flexibility. In that way it can be adapted to multiple clinical trials. This tool has been tested with a real case for a clinical assay in Melanoma disease including two data analysis and visualization components for gene expression data: heatmap visualization and gene regulatory network inference. From its initial use to the collection of data analysis results, this tool eliminates the obstacles typical of clinical research by allowing the insertion and manipulation of data at any time in a simple way for the user.
